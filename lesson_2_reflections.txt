1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   An empty, special folder, called .git, is created where every commit, along with any other necessary files, are saved.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

   The staging area differs from the working directory in that it isn't a directory, but a temporary area where files are
   staged for the next commit. Also, it differs from a repository in that it doesn't save commits or other files, just the
   files that will be commited next.
   The staging area offers a level of control on what will be commited, allowing to exclude files that the developer doesn't
   want to be commited, or separate the changed files into multiple commits.
